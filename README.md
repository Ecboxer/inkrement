Inkrement
=========

Inkrement provides tools for incremental data analysis. You might find it most useful when the questions you have can be answered from a subset of your data. The tools may also be useful in determining if a partial view of your data can be used to draw conclusions, ie are differences in your data by orders of magnitude or is your data fairly homogeneous.  

For usage example see the [project website](https://ecboxer.github.io/projects/inkrement/).
